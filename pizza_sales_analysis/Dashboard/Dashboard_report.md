## Consolidated Key Findings and Recommendations

* **Peak Demand Management:** High order volumes on Fridays, Saturdays, Thursdays and during July/May and January indicate a need for increased staffing, optimized inventory, and targeted promotions during these times.
* **Menu Optimization:**
    * **Promote Bestsellers:** Focus marketing efforts on "The Classic Deluxe Pizza" and "The Thai Chicken Pizza" as they are key drivers of quantity and revenue, respectively. Consider featuring them prominently.
    * **Re-evaluate Underperformers:** The "Brie Carre Pizza" is consistently the worst seller. Consider removing it from the menu, revamping its recipe, or offering it as a limited-time special to test new interest.
* **Pricing Strategy:** The dominance of "Large" pizzas suggests customers are willing to spend more for larger sizes. Consider bundles or family deals around these sizes.
* **Category Focus:** Continue to emphasize the "Classic" pizza category and explore expanding offerings within this successful category. Address the lower performance of the "Chicken" category, perhaps through new recipes or targeted promotions.
* **Customer Experience:** Given an average of 2.32 pizzas per order, explore bundling options or suggestive selling at checkout to gently encourage slightly higher order values (e.g., adding a side or drink).
